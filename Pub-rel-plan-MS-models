EM Toolbox- Multispecies status and plans 

Bigger Picture Planning - Multispecies Modeling/Software Course
- Ron and Howard standing meetings to just focus on planning final release testing and course development (teach student about modeling and get them to used the software for final release testing). Draft course overview attached. 
- These meeting will be centered on testing the software internally,  software "leveling" - making sure each package has a consistent feel, fleshing out the details of a course.
- Planning for Howard to go down to Florida during the last week of January to work with Ron on some focused software testing and course development.
- Point to consider, do video tutorials for all software packages  
- A manual (pdf) with the written materials for background and theory of the modeling approaches 
and the manual would have links to videos on how to use the software.
